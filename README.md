# HTTPoison [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/edgurgel/httpoison.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/edgurgel/httpoison)

HTTP client for Elixir, based on [HTTPotion](https://github.com/myfreeweb/httpotion)

## But... why something so similar to HTTPotion?

HTTPoison uses hackney to execute HTTP requests instead of ibrowse. I like hackney :thumbsup:

Using hackney we work only with binaries instead of string lists. However, hackney does not have async requests like ibrowse.

## Usage

```elixir
iex> HTTPoison.start
:ok
iex> HTTPoison.get "http://localhost:4000"
HTTPoison.Response[body: "...", headers: [{"Connection","Keep-Alive"}...], status_code: 200]

iex> HTTPoison.get "http://localhost:1"
** (HTTPoison.HTTPError) econnrefused
```

You can also extend it to make cool API clients or something (this example uses [jsex](https://github.com/talentdeficit/jsex) for JSON):

```elixir
defmodule GitHub do
  use HTTPoison.Base
  def process_url(url) do
    "https://api.github.com/" <> url
  end
  def process_response_body(body) do
    json = JSEX.decode! body
    json = Enum.map json, fn ({k, v}) -> { binary_to_atom(k), v } end
    json
  end
end

iex> GitHub.start
iex> GitHub.get("users/myfreeweb").body[:public_repos]
37
```
